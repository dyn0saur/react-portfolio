    <Template title="Pimatgol, Walkable Again: Craft-Industry Regeneration in Jongno" hero="/images/projects/thesis/hero.png">
      <p>
      Graduation project (2022) proposing a regeneration method for the Pimatgol district parallel to Jongno. The design reframes the alley’s historical identity and turns it into a pedestrian-first corridor with contiguous workshops and small retail operated by local “Makers,” leveraging the manufacturing base of Sewoon/Euljiro. A curtain wall is wrapped with three vertical panels per floor—a twisted-aluminum, solar-shading system developed through Rhino/Grasshopper to iterate façade patterns and embed system detailing. The outcome aims to make Pimatgol “walkable again,” catalyzing street life while aligning with local industry.
