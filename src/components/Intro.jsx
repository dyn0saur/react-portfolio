          <p>I am a <u>fa√ßade engineer</u> specializing in <u>computational design</u>, with a focus on realizing architectural intent into <u>buildable solutions</u>.</p>
          <p>Leveraging proficiency in Rhino, Grasshopper, and BIM workflows, I integrate parametric modeling with precise detailing to deliver projects from schematic design through construction documentation, including fabrication shop drawings and on-site coordination.</p>
          <p>My expertise lies in developing rational, fabrication-ready solutions for complex geometries, balancing aesthetics, performance, and structural integrity, while applying Value Engineering principles to optimize cost-effectiveness without compromising design intent.</p>
